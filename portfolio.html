          <p>
            I was recently invited to perform at an audiovisual festival on
            campus, along with friends who make claymations and techno music.
            For the show, I developed a NodeJS web app that used websockets to
            allow people to control 'dancing' characters in the visuals. For
            the visuals themselves, I created a Unity app that served as the
            glue between a variety of visual effects:
          </p>
          <p>1) the dancing characters (controlled by viewers' phones via websocket)</p>
          <p>2) live-edited GLSL shaders that morphed in response to incoming audio</p>
          <p>3) midi-triggered claymation loops and</p>
          <p>4) live midi-controlled Unity camera effects.</p>
          <p>
            Over the course of this project I learned how to use websockets
            to pass data between apps and demonstrated the ability to organize
            people with divergent talents (animation, music production, and
            programming) into a cohesive team that was able to produce a
            "brain-melting" performance.

            Over the course of this intense project, I learned how to
            design data structures to solve certain problems and how
            to think in the functional programming paradigm. It wasn't easy:
            my code was pretty
            <a href="https://github.com/radio-alice/racket-hw/blob/master/graded-work/graded-project2">
            broken</a> at the penultimate checkpoint, but I stuck with it,
            worked out all the issues and got
            <a href="https://github.com/radio-alice/racket-hw/blob/master/graded-work/graded-project3">
            full points</a> on the final project.

            I thought it would be funny if people could text my mom
            right from my website, so I made an little web app for it.
            To build this, I taught myself Node, Express, MongoDB and
            some light form verification to make sure people could only
            send her emojis.

            One of the first things I ever made- a poetry generator that uses
            search, not ML. Go to your fave wiki, grab some text, shove it in
            the form, press generate, see what happens. It's not set up for
            validation, so you could break it pretty easily if you wanted.

            I was recently invited to perform at an audiovisual festival on
            campus, along with friends who make claymations and techno music.
            For the show, I developed a NodeJS web app that used websockets to
            allow people to control 'dancing' characters in the visuals. For
            the visuals themselves, I created a Unity app that served as the
            glue between a variety of visual effects:
          </p>
          <p>1) the dancing characters (controlled by viewers' phones via websocket)</p>
          <p>2) live-edited GLSL shaders that morphed in response to incoming audio</p>
          <p>3) midi-triggered claymation loops and</p>
          <p>4) live midi-controlled Unity camera effects.</p>
          <p>
            Over the course of this project I demonstrated an ability to
            teach myself new technologies and to organize people with divergent
            talents (animation, music production, and programming) into a
            cohesive team that was able to produce a "brain-melting"
            performance.

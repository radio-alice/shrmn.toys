        overall structure
        - piece
        â€“ how made
        - questions
        - discussion/me talk
        rationale:
          I already know what I think, need to hear how this hits others
          Whatever I made prob gets the point a
            cross better than anything I could say

      <!---
        very first web thing [html form elements moving around page]
        what kind of interaction does this demand?
        how does this ask us to think?
        goals:
          open up tech- break it: reveal alternate possibilities
      --->
      <li><a href="mom">toy #2</a></li>
      <!---
        very first thing using a backend, db
        what kind of intimacy does this create?
        how does this ask us to think?
        goals:
          open up intimacy- make it vulnerable to tech
          (bc it already is- make that vulnerability explicit)

        talk about dat/peer2peer
        "Solarpunk can see the spots where trees have broken through the
          asphalt for what they are: great places to grow trees"

        how do these try to reconfigure relationships to networks/tech?
        how do they succeed/fail?

        goals:
          imagine a real post-
          imagine the better alternative relationships

          Big Questions:
            could the same person(a) have created all of these?
                (how does the internet demand authenticity now?)
            what lies in between the broken (anti-) and the whole (post-)?
            what do we do with any of it?
              (our lives are still broken and controlled)
